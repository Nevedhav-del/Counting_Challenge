## Description


## Non-AI Approach Requirements:
•	Google Collab Setup
•	Ensure that you have a Google account to access Google Collab.
•	Google Drive should be organized with datasets correctly placed in the drive paths.

## Libraries and Dependencies

•	OpenCV: An open-source computer vision and machine learning software library.
•	Install using! pip install OpenCV-python-headless.
•	NumPy: A library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.
•	Install using! pip install numpy.
•	Matplotlib: A plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy.
•	Install using! pip install matplotlib.

## Dataset Preparation
•	Ensure the datasets are uploaded to Google Drive and accessible via the given paths.
•	Images should be in common formats like .jpg or .png.
•	Google Drive Mounting
•	Mount Google Drive to Collab to access the datasets using drive. Mount('/content/drive').

## Code Execution Steps
•	Import necessary libraries (OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib).
•	Define paths to datasets.
•	Implement image processing functions:
•	Load and preprocess the images (grayscale conversion, blurring, edge detection).
•	Find contours and count the number of items.
•	Draw contours on images and display them.
•	Iterate over images in the datasets and process each image.
